<h1>Maze Solver</h1>

<p>This is an animated and interactive maze solver made with pygame.<br> To interact with it (adding your own walls/visited nodes/dead-end dots), left click on the nodes(white dots) to make it dead or reclick (left click) on it to make it available (alive again).<br> Use the UP button to activate the algorithm when you have filled in your dead-ends.</p>
<p>It had 3 algorithms that it can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>BFS</li>
<li>DFS</li>
<li>Dijkstra's algorithm</li>
</ul>
